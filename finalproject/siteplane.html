            <h2>1. SITE NAME</h2>
            <p><strong>Proposed Name:</strong> Sicilia Trek Hub</p>
            <p><strong>Reason for Selection:</strong> I chose this name because It's clear and immediately communicates the focus on trekking in Sicily.</p>

            <h2>2. SITE PURPOSE</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this site is to offer a useful and informative service to those who wish to discover Sicily sustainably. Therefore, the site proposes trekking activities as an opportunity to enhance and discover the Sicilian landscape. I would like to share the beauty of Sicily. Sicily is an Italian region with special status, with Palermo as its capital. It is the largest of the Italian and Mediterranean islands, the seventh largest in Europe, and the 45th largest island in the world. It is bordered to the north by the Tyrrhenian Sea, to the west by the Strait of Sicily, to the southwest by the Sea of ​​Sicily, to the southeast by the Strait of Malta, to the east by the Ionian Sea, and to the northeast by the Strait of Messina, which separates it from Calabria. The remainder consists of the Aeolian, Egadi, and Pelagie archipelagos, as well as the islands of Ustica and Pantelleria. It is the largest region in Italy and the fifth largest in population. Sicily is a predominantly hilly region (61.4% of the territory), with 24.5% mountainous and the remaining 14.1% flat; the largest plain is the Catania Plain. The relief varies, and while the Sicilian Apennines in eastern Sicily can be considered the ideal continuation of the Calabrian Apennines, central and western Sicily are home to isolated massifs. The island's second-highest peak, after Mount Etna (3,357 meters), is located in the Madonie Mountains: Pizzo Carbonara (1,979 meters).I'd like to create three pages that answer the following questions: What's a suitable itinerary for beginners? Where can I find advice on essential gear for the current season? Which natural areas can I visit that don't require a high level of trekking? So I'll create "Destinations," "Adventures," and "Home." Within each of them, I'll include images with information.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Home:</strong>In the home page, I'll include a site overview and a presentation of who we are and what we offer.</li>
                <li><strong>Destinations:</strong>In this page I'll include the destinations my site offers with brief descriptions of each location.</li>
                <li><strong>Adventures:</strong> This page Adventures, I'll include the difficulty level of each location.</li>
            </ul>
